## Lessons
- The app requires valid WHOOP API credentials to function properly
- Some method references in the ViewModel are incomplete and need implementation
- CoreData implementation should be a priority for proper data persistence
- Always make sure service properties are properly initialized before use
- Check for nested functions that should be at class level
- Use custom visualizations like circular progress indicators instead of standard components for better UI
- Implement empty states for all data-dependent views to handle cases when data is not available
- When creating complex UI, organize code into smaller, focused components for better maintainability
- Use dedicated files for major app sections to keep code organization clean
- Implement data migrations with backward compatibility to avoid breaking changes
- Use singletons for service classes that need to be accessible throughout the app
- Use ASWebAuthenticationSession for better OAuth flow handling instead of custom web views
- Implement CSRF protection using state parameter validation for all OAuth flows
- Store sensitive data like tokens in the Keychain rather than UserDefaults
- Add detailed error messages for all authentication-related errors to improve user experience
- Implement token refresh mechanisms to handle expired access tokens automatically
- Request only the HealthKit permissions that are actually needed by the app
- Use background delivery for HealthKit data with appropriate update frequencies
- Implement observers for health data types that need real-time updates
- Properly clean up HealthKit observers and queries when they're no longer needed
- Convert between different units for consistent display of health metrics
